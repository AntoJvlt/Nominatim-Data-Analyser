# Reporting errors in the rules

We do not have a system to automatically report data as false positive yet.

If you find a big chunk of data for a rule which are not real errors and that it can possibly
be fix by modifing a bit the rule's logic, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/AntoJvlt/Nominatim-Data-Analyser/issues)
to discuss it.
